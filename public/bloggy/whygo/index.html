I am referring to it's api and it's ability to uncouple code. Why is this important? Many developers are bound to the constraints to their language and tech stack. The point is so that when your project gets bigger you are not constrained to what you have already created. <br> An example of what I am referring to.</p> <pre class=svelte-106qo07><code class=svelte-106qo07>type Guitarist struct{ Name string } //object

func (g Guitarist) Run() { fmt.Println(g) } // method

type Musician interface{ Run() } //interface that uses the method
</code></pre> The three bits of code that are stated are pretty simple. but they are the building blocks to uncoupling code. <ul><li>1. struct </li> <li>2. method </li> <li>3. interface </ul> Lets say you are building a Service on Musican. <pre class=svelte-106qo07><code class=svelte-106qo07>type Musician interface{ Run() } //interface that uses the method
</code></pre> Meaning....<br> We used the interface Musician to allow for any struct with run() to be passed in. A lot of poeple miss this point when seeing the word interface because of it's different meaning in other languages. This allows for not having to think about your data or concrete data type. Something many languages you are tied to. <br> Another thing a lot of people miss from other languages is that you can do embedding on this interface type. <pre class=svelte-106qo07><code class=svelte-106qo07>type Musicman interface{ Musician }
</code></pre> By doing so you are attempting to turn an interface "type" into a value. A value that initally does not have a value but carries methods. <br><br> <p style="color:#95e152;text-shadow:0 0 3px #000,0 0 5px #f0f0f0">Why would you want to do such a thing?</p> <hr> <br> Really it is more of the later open decision to extend a type. Meaning if you have a lot of methods tied up to this type and so it is bound by the adding of methods, then you need a way to utilize this type but still not couple it to a hierachy. <pre class=svelte-106qo07><code class=svelte-106qo07>
1. type Guitarist struct{ Name string } //object

2. func (g Guitarist) Run() { fmt.Println(g) } // method

3. func Running(m Musicman) { fmt.Println("Musician works") } // function

4. type Musician interface{ Run() } //interface that has the method

5. type Musicman interface{ Musician } //interface that is embedded

</code></pre> 5. is just a function that takes in the embedded interface type. The reason I added this was to demonstrate the use of embedded networkInterface types. <br> <br> 3. is utilizing the embedded interface as a parameter. <br> <br> Here is a working <a href=https://play.golang.org/p/Fs_PKx1mN6V style=color:#f9845b target=_blank>example</a> of the code. <br> <hr> An abstract class will only get you so far in uncoupling code. Mainly because it is an object and it becomes coupled when you want to start or change instances of it. It also becomes heavy when you attempt to remove or add properties/methods and create objects of it. This is why I personally love go. It really shines in a future uncoupling sense. I hope people who read this can get a good idea of the importance of uncoupling code. </div></main></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"",preloaded:[void 0,null,{}]};if('serviceWorker' in navigator)navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');var s=document.createElement("script");try{new Function("if(0)import('')")();s.src="/client/client.7d4acdd1.js";s.type="module";s.crossOrigin="use-credentials";}catch(e){s.src="/client/shimport@1.0.1.js";s.setAttribute("data-main","/client/client.7d4acdd1.js")}document.head.appendChild(s)</script>
